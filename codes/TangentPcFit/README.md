# FitTanCapillaryModel

This is a capillary model that we have proposed based on a tangent function:

**P<sub>c</sub> = A + B * tan(π/2 - π * S<sub>e</sub><sup>C</sup>)**

## Model Description

- **S<sub>e</sub>**: The effective saturation, defined as (S<sub>w</sub> - S<sub>wi</sub>) / (1 - S<sub>or</sub> - S<sub>wi</sub>).
- **A, B, and C**: These parameters are used for fitting the model.
- **S<sub>wi</sub> and S<sub>or</sub>**: Residual wetting and non-wetting saturations, which can also be considered as fitting parameters.

## Usage

The input to the code should include lists of Sw (water saturation) and capillary pressure.
