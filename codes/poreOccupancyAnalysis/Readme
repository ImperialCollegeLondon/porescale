In this GitHub repository, you will find the code that enables the quantification of pore and throat occupancy in a 3D micro-CT image. The code processes pore network data extracted from dry scan images using a dedicated pore network extraction algorithm. To familiarize yourself with the network extraction process from dry scans, please check out the "pnextract" repository at the following link:

https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/pnextract.git

Subsequently, the wet image is mapped onto the extracted network. Please note that the preferred format for wet images is TIFF.

This code generates the mapping results and provides the distribution of pores and throats based on the input data. 

Included in the repository is a standalone software in the form of a binary file, which simplifies the entire process. A sample file is provided for you to test the software and familiarize yourself with its functionality.
